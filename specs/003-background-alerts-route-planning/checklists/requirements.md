# Specification Quality Checklist: Background Alerts and Route Planning

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Note: Mapbox mentioned in user input but kept as assumption
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - Resolved with weighted scoring approach (marked as TODO for future refinement)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items passed
- One TODO marker added for weighted scoring formula (FR-012) - to be refined during implementation
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- Background location services will require platform-specific implementations (iOS/Android) during development
